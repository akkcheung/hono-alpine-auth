# Hono.js Authentication with Alpine.js SPA

This project demonstrates a simple Single Page Application (SPA) using Hono.js for the backend and Alpine.js for the frontend. It features user authentication with JWT, dynamic content loading without page refreshes, and a SQLite database for user storage.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Single Page Application (SPA) functionality using Alpine.js
- Server-side rendering with Mustache templates
- SQLite database for user storage
- Password hashing for security
- Protected routes
- Logout functionality
- Swagger UI for API documentation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hono-alpine-auth.git
   cd hono-alpine-auth
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your JWT secret:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Use the navigation to switch between login and logout pages without full page reloads

## API Endpoints

- `GET /login`: Serves the login page
- `POST /login`: Handles user login
- `GET /logout`: Handles user logout
- `GET /auth/welcome`: Protected route, shows welcome message for authenticated users

## Technologies Used

- [Hono.js](https://honojs.dev/): Lightweight web framework for Node.js
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/): Minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): Self-contained, serverless database engine
- [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js): Logic-less templates for JavaScript
- [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken): JSON Web Token implementation for Node.js

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed before storage
- JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Protected routes are secured with JWT middleware
